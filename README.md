Code that grabs data from a product on dlsite. I made this to get sales and other data from the site without having to manually go through each page and write stuff down. dlsite_example.py shows all 3 ways that I inteded to use the code. The code itself definitely isn't the greatest because this is the first thing I've written in python, but everything works.


Be sure to:
  1. install all the proper modules. Selenium, Beautiful Soup, etc.
  2. have chrome driver installed.
