Code that grabs data from a product on dlsite. I wanted to get sales and stuff from the site without having to manually go through each page and write stuff down, so here this is. dlsite_example.py shows all 3 ways that I inteded to use the code. The code itself definitely isn't the greatest because this is the first thing I've written in python, but everything works.
